I press a button to take a screenshot WITH mpv. It goes Directly into Anki via Anki connect.

I press a button to start recording audio, 20 ms latency max. I press button again to end recording. It goes into Anki.

I get a "select last 2 subtitles," "select last subtitle," "select last 3 subtitles" thing.

The side panel has a "click word to send into Anki" button, just for the word.

The side panel, I can click and drag to select a phrase or multi-word segment.
