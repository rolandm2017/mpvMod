# Requirements

This program is built to be used on, at a minimum, a laptop monitor, consuming about 3/5ths of the width of the screen.

I'm assuming all users will be using it with MPV on a desktop or laptop. How would you use MPV on mobile?

Testing the program on _just_ a laptop, without an attached second monitor, is on my to-do list.
